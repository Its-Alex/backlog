# Backlog

This repository functions as my personal backlog, encompassing all the tasks I
aim to complete or am presently involved in.

I began this project inspired by [LearnInPublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public),
which ignited a motivation to document the tasks I undertake and the rationale
behind my methods.

You can visit the [issues section of this project](https://github.com/Its-Alex/backlog/issues)
to track my current activities.
